## Inspiration

Inspired by our favorite

- sorting algorithm: gnome sort
- computer science classroom: the obnoxiously overcrowded biology building known
  as Genome

## What it does

> Lost in the human body, all our heroic gnome can do is sort... sort genomes,
> that is!
>
> Designed for education about genetic disorders and gnome sort, this
> cleverly-titled game combines the hilarity of gnome sort with the seriousness
> of cancer.
>
> Genetic mutations are diseases caused by changes in the genetic sequence. In
> this game we treat the mutation by untangling the altered genetic sequences.

In our game, the player simulates a gnome in a petri dish, sorting human genomes
to eliminate cancer-causing disorders.

See [help](https://benknoble.github.io/genomesort/help.html) for how to play!

## How we built it

We built in vanilla javascript and the [phaser game engine](https://phaser.io).

GitHub generously hosts our project using GitHub pages.

Also including lots of love :heart:.

## Challenges we ran into

- swapping the genes
- scene transitions (phaser scene usage)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- scene transitions
- cleanliness of the help site
- buttons
- our gnome-sorting players

## What we learned

- how to use HTML/JS
- how to use phaser
- git
- game design
